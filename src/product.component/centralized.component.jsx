                <h1>Centralised Distribution System</h1>

                <h4>1. Better control :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One of the advantages of having a centralized distribution
                    is to have better control. Organizations setup central
                    stores which are responsible for all activities and
                    transport their inventory as and when required to other
                    stores which are usually attached to the production
                    capacities located in different locations.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Inventory management :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Inventory can be as minimum as material ordered based on the
                    requirement of all other attached parties. The material can
                    also be ruled out to and from the attached central stores.
                    This is especially so in the case of tools, fixtures,
                    equipment and spares.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Reduced cost :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    By choosing to centralize warehousing and distribution, the
                    need to pay rent or utility and incidental expenditures for
                    different warehouses is reduced. The need to spend more on
                    new equipment and technologies for each warehouse is also
                    eliminated.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Centralized warehouses also makes room to reduce the
                    shipping costs. That may seem strange but the reason for
                    that is because it makes room for shipping in bulk size wich
                    will makes the costs lower.
                    <br /><br /> With these reductions in costs, retailers can now set
                    pricing strategies with more ease due to the more stable
                    nature of its inventory management. This will allow for
                    higher margins or lower prices for customers.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Requirement of fewer personnel :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Unnecessary duplication of records takes place in
                    decentralized Stores. centralized stores will require less
                    personnel for management. For smaller business this can be
                    one of the most important reasons for having decentralized
                    distrubution systems. With not having as big financial
                    pressure on you, you can be able to have better focus which
                    will improve all parts of you life.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Economy in storage :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Is possible in a centralized distribution system as goods in
                    bulk will occupy less space. That will offer you even lower
                    renting costs, which will make you able to spend invest more
                    into the other thing like marketing.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>6. Accessibility :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One of the biggest advantages of having all the products in
                    one central location means getting easy access whenever
                    needed. That also makes it easier for you to handle some
                    kinds crises. The reason for that is you know something is
                    missing for example you can check it instantly.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>7. Reporting :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Depending on the kind of business or the kinds of products
                    you offer to your customers, you need to keep a close eye on
                    what you have in stock. With a central distribution center,
                    creating these types of reports becomes incredibly easy. You
                    only have to go to one source rather than track down
                    multiple reports from multiple distribution centers.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>8. Standardization :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Implementing centralization would result in standardization
                    of the processes. This guarantees lesser variations and
                    better performance. It will asave from a lot of petential
                    headache and make it easier for you to make decisions.
                    <br /><br />
                    Because of that will you not only save money on having a
                    centralized distrubution system. You will save something way
                    more precious namely your time. That will give you more time
                    to do the things that will make you able to really grow your
                    business like strateigizing, developing new leader etc.
                    <br /><br />
                    Besides that can it help you establish yourself as more
                    reliable. The reason fot that is that the shipping will
                    always be the same and that will offer you an competetive
                    advantage against competitiors. Look at Mr Bezos he had as
                    his corneratone to have a fast and relieable delevery system
                    and he is pretty succesful from what i know.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>9. Flexibility :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In a crisis or an emergency, standardization of work takes
                    just one step to revise all the activities at once. This
                    guarantees a greater degree of flexibility in an
                    organization than in a company with no centralized
                    warehousing.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>

                <h4>10. Better customer service :</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    By choosing to limit the number of warehouses or
                    distributors, a company can focus its resources on fewer
                    facilities. This means the facility will have highly skilled
                    workers, the latest technology and the best equipment. With
                    all of this in one facility, the highest quality of service
                    can be offered to customers
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </React.Fragment>
        );
    }
}

export default centralized;
