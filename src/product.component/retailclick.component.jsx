                  The Software is designed and developed keeping in mind the
                  typical requirements of the Indian conditions existing at
                  Stores and shops; such as multiple pricing, promotional
                  schemes, customer credit limit checks, home delivery,

                  The Software is essentially the business owner's or stake
                  holders’ 'Business-Partner'. This is because, the software
                  provides very valuable information and tips to the owner on
                  how to run his shop in a profitable and cost-effective manner,
                  by optimizing the purchases, sale-prices, streamlining the
                  ordering just-in-time and keeping optimum levels of inventory.
                  A large number of periodic reports gives full insight to the
                  owner on whether the day-to-day business operations are
                  running as per his/her vision and how to increase its
                  efficiency and profitability.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It also tells the owner about the operator performance,
                  fast-moving items, daily, monthly and seasonal sales reports,
                  item-wise profit, sales analysis, tax-collected, pending home
                  deliveries and market valuation of the stock present. In
                  addition, the package provides Inventory and Accounting up to
                  balance-Sheet and Profit-and-Loss level to the owner.
                  <br />
